kernel-features:
    question: 
        big: |
            what Linux kernel features make containers work?
    answer: 
        small: |
            1. cgroups
            2. namespaces
            3. capabilities
            4. seccomp-bpf
            5. overlayfs

kernel-feature-memory:
    question: 
        big: |
            which kernel feature lets you restrict memory/cpu usage?
    answer: 
        big: cgroups!
        small: |
            cgroups let you set memory and/or CPU limits for a group of processes

ps-processes:
    question: 
        big: |
            why can't you see other processes on the computer when you run `ps` in a container?
    answer: 
        big: because the container has its own PID namespace

own-pid:
    question: 
        big: |
            can a process have more than one PID?
    answer: 
        big: yes!
        small: |
            a container process will one PID in its PID namespace and a different PID in the host PID namespace

docker-required:
    question: 
        big: |
            do you need to use Docker to create a container?
    answer: 
        big: |
            no!
        small: |
            some other container runtimes are systemd-nspawn and LXC

just-use-cgroups:
    question: 
        big: |
            can you use cgroups without using namespaces?
    answer: 
        big: |
            yes!
        small: |
            all of the "container" kernel features (cgroups, namespaces, capabilities, etc) can be used independently of one another

whats-inside:
    question: 
        big: |
            what does it means to run a command "inside" a container
    answer: 
        small: |
            run the command with the same cgroups and namespaces as the container's processes

nsenter-command:
    question: 
        big: |
            what command lets you run a command inside a container's mount namespace?
    answer: 
        big: |
            nsenter!
        small: |
            you can run a command inside any/all of a container's namespaces with nsenter

prevent:
    question: 
        big: |
            what are 2 ways to prevent
            containers from doing
            scary things?
    answer: 
        big: |
            capabilities
            and seccomp-bpf!
        small: |
            seccomp-bpf whitelists system calls and capabilities only allow certain categories of activity
exceed-memory:
    question: 
        big: |
            what happens when a container exceeds its memory limit?
    answer: 
        small: |
            depending on your system's configuration, either:

            1. it starts swapping
            2. processes inside the container get OOM killed

ip-address:
    question: 
        big: |
            do containers have their own IP addresses?
    answer: 
        big: |
            often they do!
        small: |
            docker gives containers IP addresses by default. The container IP may or may not be accessible from other computers, though!

memory-tracking:
    question: 
        big: |
            can you track how much memory / CPU a container is using?
    answer: 
        big: |
            yes!
        small: |
            look for files named memory.usage_in_bytes in /sys/fs/cgroup

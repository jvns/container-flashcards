fragment:
    question: 
        big: |
            when you go to the URL
            `https://fruit.com/#banana`,
            does `#banana` get sent to the server?
        small: |
            a. yes
            b. no
    answer: 
        big: no!
        small: |
            The fragment (`#banana`) isn't sent in the HTTP request the browser sends, so only frontend code can see it.
            
every-website-http:
    question: 
        big: |
            does every website use HTTP?
        small: |
            a. yes!
            b. no!
    answer: 
        big: |
            a. yes!
        small: |
            every time your browser visits a website, it uses the HTTP
            protocol

request-parts:
    question: 
        big: |
            what are the 4 parts of a HTTP request?
    answer: 
        small: |
            1. the method (like GET)
            2. the path (like /cat.png)
            3. the headers
            4. the body

response-parts:
    question: 
        big: |
            what are the 3 parts of a HTTP response?
    answer: 
        small: |
            1. the response code (like 200)
            2. the headers
            3. the body


request-method-get:
    question: 
        big: |
            when you go to `http://fruit.com/page` in your browser, what request method does it use?
        small: |
            a. GET
            b. POST
            c. CONNECT
    answer: 
        big: GET
        small: |
            every time you visit a webpage, your browser makes a `GET` request to the server. The request looks like this:

            `GET /page HTTP/1.1`
            `Host: fruit.com`
            `User-Agent: mozilla-or-whatever`
        
request-method-post:
    question: 
        big: |
            when you submit a form, what request method does your browser use?
        small: |
            a. GET
            b. POST
            c. it depends!
    answer: 
        big: it depends!
        small: |
            The default is `POST`, but you can use `<form method="GET">` to send a GET request.

            `POST` puts the form data in the request body.
            `GET` puts the data in the URL.
 
what-part-html:
    question: 
        big: |
            what should the
            Content-Type header be
            for a request/response
            with a JSON body?
        small: |
            a. application/json
            b. json
            c. text/json
    answer: 
        big: |
            a. application/json
        small: |
            if you don't set `Content-Type` to the right value, often the client/server on the other end won't recognize it!
            
browser-view-http-request:
    question: 
        big: |
            when your browser makes a HTTP request, can you see the request and response?
        small: |
            a. yes! I can see anything my browser does!
            b. no, not if it's encrypted.
    answer: 
        big: yes!
        small: |
            You can use the Network tab in developer tools to view every single HTTP request your browser is making for you!
            
 
500-error:
    question: 
        big: |
            if a request's response code is 500, what does it mean?
        small: |
            a. client error
            b. server error
            c. it could mean anything!
    answer: 
        big: b. server error
        small: |
            technically a HTTP server can return whatever response code it wants
            But according to the specification, codes starting 5 mean a server error.

js-request-limits:
    question: 
        big: |
            can your frontend Javascript code make any HTTP request it wants?
        small: |
            a. yeah, it's a program, of course!
            b. no, there are limits!
    answer: 
        big: no!
        small: |
            The browser runs your Javascript code, and it puts limits (for
            security reasons) on what HTTP requests it can make.
            
            The main limit is called the
            "Same-origin policy"

            packets can be lost, delayed, or corrupted! It happens all the time.
            
thing:
    question:
        big: |
            suppose you send a network packet in a TCP connection. How can you tell if the recipient got that packet or not?
    answer:
        big: they send an ACK!
        small: |
            # TODO: WRONG
            the recipient will send an ACK packet with the sequence number of
            the most recent packet they've received

    question: 
        big: |
            do HTTP requests use TCP?
    answer: 
        big: yes!
        small: |
            sometimes they use a newer protocol called QUIC (over UDP) but most
            HTTP requests are over TCP
